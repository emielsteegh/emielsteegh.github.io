I was born in a rural part of Limburg. I'm passionate about data, forecasting, NLP, and complex problems. At the moment I'm looking for a job in data science and innovation or research where I can learn and grow.

I am a graduated Master in Data Science from the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/), with a Bachelor in Creative Technology from the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/), where I learned all about rapid prototyping and bridging the gap between engineering, business and the real world. I really enjoy working with a AI to improve our world.

I run my own small business, I have worked as a freelancer, back-end developer, I like tinkering with code-projects for fun, even worked as a wedding photographer, and most proudly as [teaching assistant](/teaching/); I love to share knowledge!
During my time at the University of Twente I spent a full-time year as secretary of the board of [Study Association Proto](https://www.proto.utwente.nl/page/oldfarts#board8).
