Currently I am a Master's student in Data Science at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/) working with AI in the field of NLP and active learning. 

I was born in a rural part of Limburg and I'm passionate about data, NLP, and complex problems.
I recently graduated from the Bachelor Creative Technology at the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/), where I learned all about rapid prototyping and bridging the gap between engineering, business and the real world.
During my time there I took a full-time year to be secretary of the board of [Study Association Proto](https://www.proto.utwente.nl/page/oldfarts#board8).

I run my own small business, I have worked as a freelancer, back-end developer, and most proudly as [teaching assistant](/teaching/); I love to share knowledge!
