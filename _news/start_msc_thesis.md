    I am glad to announce that I started my Master's thesis at the municipality of Amsterdam's Data Science Team ðŸŽŠ! 
    For the next half year I will be working with pre trained language models and active learning to help tackle a low resource document problem.
    I'm very stoked to work with all the amazing people here.
