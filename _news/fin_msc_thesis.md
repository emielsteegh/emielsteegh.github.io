I officially graduated from the Master's Data Science finishing with a 8.6/10 GPA. Hurrah, cum laude! ☺️. I obtainied a 9/10 for my thesis on [NLP with active learning for classification in a low-resource language setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/placeholder_the_article_is_on_its_way). As a next step we're looking to publish a paper from the works.
